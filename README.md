# Eukaryotic diversity, composition and seasonal variability in the gut microbiome of Wild Baboons in Amboseli Ecosystem, Kenya

Animals coexist with complex microbiota that include bacteria, viruses, and eukaryotes (e.g., fungi, protists, and helminths). To date, the composition of bacterial and viral components of animal microbiota, and their effects on their hosts, are increasingly well-understood, but eukaryotic composition remains neglected. Here we characterize the diversity, composition, and seasonal variation of gut eukaryotes in wild baboons, analyzing their association with the hostâ€™s social structure and seasonal variation. 

Here, **we analyzed fecal samples from two sets of samples from a wild baboon population in the Amboseli ecosystem, Kenya to test the effects of social group membership, seasonality, host sex, and age**. DNA from these samples was subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing, revealing members of the kingdoms Protista, Chromista, and Fungi in 90.7%, 46.7%, and 20.3% of samples, respectively. We found that social group membership explained 13% of the global diversity in gut eukaryotic species composition. However, season, host age, and host sex did not explain variation in gut eukaryotic communities. Across the samples, the most prevalent Protists were Entamoeba coli (74.66%), Enteromonas hominis (53.33%), and Blatocystis subtype 3 (38%), while the most prevalent Fungi included Pichia manshurica (14.66%), and Ogataea naganishii (6.66%). 

Our results highlight the relevance of Protista and Fungi as integral members of the gut microbiome of wild baboons, with implications for understanding host-microbiome associations in the context of primate conservation, wildlife health monitoring, and management strategies.

# Workflow
First, we analysed the eukaryotic composition across all samples, from both sets of data. 


We then dive into the analysis of the effect of social group membership.


Finally, we investigate the effect of seasonality on the eukaryotic microbiome composition.
